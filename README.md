# BuildAndRunMultipleInstances.cs

v 0.1.0

Helper class for multiplayer development in Unity.
Thanks to this script running multiple instances of the same build is automated. Testing new multiplayer code is much easier.

Tested on Unity 2018.4.8f1 LTS.

Currently, it works only on windows machines.
